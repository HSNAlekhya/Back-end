My Back-end work 

Backend development 

          It refers to the server-side of a web application, focusing on the logic, databases, and infrastructure that power the user-facing elements. 
          It ensures the site functions properly by managing data, security, and performance behind the scenes, effectively acting as the "brain" of the application. 

Core Concepts and Components

    The backend system primarily consists of three main parts:
    
    Server: 
    
      The hardware (physical or cloud-based) that receives requests from the client (web browser or mobile app), processes them, and sends a response back.
      
    Application Logic: 
    
       The core code (written in various programming languages) that defines the rules, behavior, and functions of the application, 
       such as processing user input, running algorithms, and making decisions based on data.
       
    Database: 
    
       A system for storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently. This data includes user information, product details, posts, etc.. 

 APIs (Application Programming Interface)
 
    An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate by handling data access and responses between systems.
    Backend developers use APIs to connect services and improve user experience. 
    
    Some of the APIs you should know about are:
    
    REST
    JSON
    SOAP
    GSON
    XML-RPC
    AES
